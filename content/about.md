Software engineering is not only my profession, it's also **my passion**.

Having worked in **different IT positions in multinational companies** during the most part of my career, in 2012 I decided to become a full-time software developer. First as a SAP ABAP programmer, and then as an iOS mobile engineer.

Now, after four years working in one of the most [challenging projects](https://tech.cabify.com/) you can find as a software developer, the time has come to take some time off and do the ultimate transition to **become a full-fledged backend engineer**.

I find the backend side **offers way more interesting problems to solve**. It requires not only coding skills but also a deep understanding of the business, system design thinking, how to operate systems at scale, and much more.

This blog is just a place to dump my **learnings and thoughts** during this journey. Hopefully you'll find something interesting browsing through these posts, or at least enjoy some of my **ocasional rants and off-topic stuff**... ;-)

And every now and then to dump my thoughts regarding other kind-of related topics, such as **FOSS** (Free and Open Source Software), the **tech industry**, **retro programming**, and **computing history**.

Please, reach me out via [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jerosanchez). It'll be a pleasure to engage and share ideas.
