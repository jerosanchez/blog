Software engineering is not only my profession, it's also **my passion**.

Having worked in **different IT positions in multinational companies** during the most part of my career, in 2012 I decided to become a full-time software engineer. First as a SAP ABAP programmer, and then as an iOS mobile developer.

After four years in one of the most challenging projects you can find out there in a big tech company, the time has come to do the ultimate transition and **become a full-fledged backend engineer**.

I find the backend side of software engineering **offers way more interesting problems to solve**. It requires not only coding skills but also a deep understanding of the business, system design thinking, how to operate systems at scale, and more.

This blog is just a place to document my **learnings and thoughts** during this journey.

Hopefully you'll find something valuable among these posts, or at least enjoy some of my off-topic stuff... ;-)
