After deciding I want to **transition to backend engineering**, one of the next things I need to make my mind around is which specific technology I'll be using to keep focused. The last thing you need when learning is to fall into the rabbit hole of trying to learn the myriad of fancy backend technologies out there.

I want to leverage my previous experience and the new knowledge I'll be adquiring as much as possible. Contrary to popular believe, the specific technology is not that important. If you know your craft, then you know **technology is just a means to an end**: solving problems with software. 

On the one hand, I've been **programming with Swift for 5 years**, a modern, object-oriented, strongly-typed language that also supports the functional programming paradigm.

On the other hand, I want to **get back to the trenches** as a backend engineer, eventually. And a quick look to the job market shows that, despite the layoffs we are suffering latly in the tech industry, there is a technology that seems to stand strong: Java, a language very similar to Swift in spirit, and that I learnt --and basically forgot-- long ago. 

So the winner is clear: I'll go for **Java and its (new to me) Spring Boot framework** to carry out [my crazy idea](/blog/posts/a-crazy-idea).

I apologize to the horde of new developers who say Java is dead. Maybe the [huge amount of big companies that still rely on Java](https://www.jalasoft.com/blog/companies-that-use-java) to solve their business problems means nothing to them. Or maybe **they confuse attractiveness and funcyness with technological relevance**. I don't know...

Be that as it may, the **hard facts** are that Java is a very mature technology that has proven its value during the years, has evolved very well to offer a modern development experience, has ranked consistently [in the top 5 most relevant programming languages](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) since a couple of decades ago, and there's no doubt [it continues being the future](https://blog.payara.fish/10-compelling-reasons-why-java-is-the-future-of-enterprise-app-development-in-2025) in the enterprise world.

Java is not even close to dead, it seems.
