Some weeks ago I decided to took some sabbatical time to **transition from mobile development to backend engineering**. Now the question was how could I do it without getting stuck in a tutorial hell, endless readings, or binge watching sessions in YouTube.

I wanted to feel it as if I were working --you know, these are not vacations--, but **working in something meaningful and adquate** to my goals.

And the idea simply poped up in my head: I needed to build something real, or at least **realistic enough** to solve a problem that required to put into play the technologies and skills that any competent backend enginer uses on a daily basis. 

No need to be original here. The goal was to get my hands dirty and **learn the concepts and the mindset** as quickly as possible.

Thus I came up with this crazy idea: _"I'm going to build a realistic --yet simple-- marketplace backend system from scratch, and deploy it in my own homelab"_.

And since every project needs a name, I decided to name it `BESys`, standing for Backend System --I know, I am a bored and predictable person ;-p
