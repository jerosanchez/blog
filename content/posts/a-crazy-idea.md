Some weeks ago I decided to took some sabbatical time to **transition from mobile development to backend engineering**. The question was how could I do it without getting stuck in a tutorial hell, endless readings, or binge watching sessions in YouTube.

I wanted it to feel like working--you know, sabbatical doesn't mean necessarily vacation. Just **working on something meaningful and appropriate** for my goals.

And the idea simply poped up in my head: I needed to build something real, or at least **realistic enough** to solve a problem that required bringing into play the technologies and skills that any competent backend enginer uses on a daily basis.

No need to be original here. The goal is to get my hands dirty and **and wrap my mind around the backend development** as quickly as possible.

Thus I came up with this crazy idea: _"I'm going to build a realistic --yet simple-- marketplace backend system from scratch, and deploy it in my own homelab"_.

And since every project needs a name, I decided to call it `BESys`, which stands for Backend System. I know, I am a bored and predictable person ;-p
